# Scheduling-Algo

Java simulations for static EDF, cycle-conserving EDF and LookAhead EDF for drastic Energy Saving

The following case can be used to understand the code in detail:

Task 1- Execution Time 3, Period 8

Task 2- Execution Time 3, Period 10

Task 3- Execution Time 1, Period 14

For cc-EDF, generate random number for actual execution time.
